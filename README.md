# Agentic Multi-Agent Baseline Solution

A comprehensive baseline solution for agentic and multi-agent systems using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Semantic Kernel**. This project demonstrates three progressive architecture options, from simple local deployment to cloud-native Kubernetes implementations, showcasing the evolution of multi-agent system architectures while maintaining core functionality across all variants.

## üéØ Project Vision

**Provide developers and organizations with a ready-to-use, modular, and extensible foundation for building multi-agent systems** that can be deployed across different environments and scaled according to business needs. The solution demonstrates best practices in agent orchestration, MCP integration, and progressive architecture complexity.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Progressive Architecture**: Three deployment options from local to cloud-native, allowing teams to start simple and scale complexity as needed
- **MCP Integration**: Native support for Model Context Protocol, enabling standardized agent communication
- **Semantic Kernel Foundation**: Built on Microsoft's Semantic Kernel for robust AI agent capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Support**: C# and Python agent implementations for technology diversity
- **Production-Ready Patterns**: Demonstrates industry best practices for containerization, orchestration, and deployment
- **Educational Value**: Serves as a reference architecture for learning multi-agent system design

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The solution implements a **document processing workflow** using three specialized AI agents:

1. **Content Source MCP Server**: Provides document/content access (local files & URLs) via Model Context Protocol
2. **Orchestrator Agent** (C#): Coordinates workflow and manages MCP client connections using Semantic Kernel
3. **Summarization Agent** (C#): Processes documents to generate concise summaries via MCP tools
4. **Analysis/Tagline-Creator Agent** (Python): Analyzes summaries to create compelling taglines/mottos

### Option 1: Local Implementation Architecture

                 (resources)    (stdio JSON-RPC)         (tools/resources)
```

## üìã Three Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Local Development**
- **Philosophy**: Simplicity and rapid development
- **Transport**: stdio-based MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- **Deployment**: All components on single machine
- **Use Case**: Development, testing, proof-of-concept

### **Option 2: Dockerized**
- **Philosophy**: Containerized modularity with service isolation
- **Transport**: HTTP+SSE MCP communication
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Docker Compose
- **Use Case**: Medium-scale deployments, staging environments

### **Option 3: Cloud-Native Kubernetes**
- **Philosophy**: Enterprise-grade scalability and resilience
- **Transport**: HTTP+SSE with service discovery
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes pods with Helm charts
- **Use Case**: Production workloads, scaling capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Primary Language**: C# .NET 8+ (MCP server, orchestrator, summarization agent)
- **Secondary Language**: Python 3.11+ (analysis/tagline-creator agent)
- **AI Framework**: Semantic Kernel .NET for AI capabilities
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) with JSON-RPC 2.0
- **LLM Integration**: Internal models (Azure AI Foundry GPT-4o) or MCP sampling delegation
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes 1.25+ with Helm charts
