# Multi-Agent Baseline Solution

## Summary

This project aims to create a comprehensive baseline solution for agentic and multi-agent systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Semantic Kernel. The solution provides three progressive architecture options, from simple local deployment, going through dockerized services and up to cloud-native Kubernetes implementations, demonstrating the evolution of multi-agent system architectures while maintaining core functionality across all variants.

## Product Overview

### Core value proposition:

2. **AI Agent Workflow**
   - Orchestrator Agent: Coordinates workflow and manages MCP client connections
   - Summarizer Agent: Processes documents using Semantic Kernel via MCP tools
   - Tagline-Creator Agent: Generates taglines/mottos from summaries via MCP communication
   - Sequential workflow execution with result passing through MCP protocol

3. **Content Sources as MCP Resources**

## Functional Specifications

### Content source: MCP Server Capabilities
- **Document Provider Service**: Custom MCP server exposing document content as resources and tools through the Model Context Protocol
- **Content Source Management**: Handles local file access and remote URL content fetching, exposing them as MCP resources
- **Tool Interface**: Provides MCP tools for document processing operations to be performed by decoupled agents.
- **Resource Management**: Exposes document content through MCP resource URIs with proper content negotiation

### Agent Specifications
- **Orchestrator Agent** (C#): Acts as MCP client, coordinates workflow execution, manages connections to MCP servers. It should use Semantic Kernel for that orchestration.
Implementation in .NET/C#.
- **Summarization Agent** (C#): Generates a summary from the content provided as part of the prompt. The integration with the orchestrator is always thorugh MCP, but in option 1 is stdio and in Options 2 and 3 as remote agent using Http.
Implementation in .NET/C#.
- **Analysis Agent** (Python): Analyzes summaries coming from the summarization Agent to create taglines/mottos.
The integration with the orchestrator is always thorugh MCP, but in option 1 is stdio and in Options 2 and 3 as remote agent using Http.
Implementation in Python.

### User Stories (Baseline)
1. **As a developer**, I want to deploy the MCP server locally so I can test agent workflows quickly
2. **As a user**, I want to submit a local text file so I can get automated summarization and tagline generation
3. **As a user**, I want to provide a URL so the system can process remote content automatically
4. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want to deploy using Docker so I can ensure consistent environments
5. **As a system administrator**, I want to deploy to Kubernetes so I can handle production workloads with scaling capabilities
