# Agentic Multi-Agent Baseline Solution Project

## Summary

This project aims to create a comprehensive baseline solution for agentic multi-agent systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Semantic Kernel. The solution provides three progressive architecture options, from simple local deployment to cloud-native Kubernetes implementations, demonstrating the evolution of multi-agent system architectures while maintaining core functionality across all variants.

## Product Overview

### Core value proposition:

### User Stories (Baseline)
1. **As a developer**, I want to deploy the MCP server locally so I can test agent workflows quickly
2. **As a user**, I want to submit a local text file so I can get automated summarization and tagline generation
3. **As a user**, I want to provide a URL so the system can process remote content automatically
4. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want to deploy using Docker so I can ensure consistent environments
5. **As a system administrator**, I want to deploy to Kubernetes so I can handle production workloads with scaling capabilities

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
